            <h2>The Reason for the recipe</h2>
            <p>Allergies? Nuts to that! Young Avery was born with a peanut allergy. This meant many baked goods were off the table
                since they were made with or around them. Instead of letting this keep her from things she enjoyed, Avery decided to create
                her own treats and make them peanut free. In the future she will try to create new products that are as free of as many allergens 
                as possible!
